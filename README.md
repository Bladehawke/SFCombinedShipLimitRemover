## ‚öô Requirements

- [Vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)

## Get started

### üíª Register Visual Studio as a Generator

- Open `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt`
- Run `cmake`
- Close the cmd window

### üî® Building

- [CommonLibSF](https://github.com/Starfield-Reverse-Engineering/CommonLibSF)
- [DKUtil](https://github.com/gottyduke/DKUtil)

These two dependencies can be setup either via git submodule (by executing `update-submodule.bat`) or through a local git repo (by specifying environment variable `CommonLibSFPath` and `DKUtilPath` pointing to local git repo path).

> If having multiple projects, to avoid having copies of CommonLibSF and DKUtil in each of them, it's suggested to use the local fork and environment path approach, so all projects share the same package.

```
.\make-sln-msvc.bat
cmake --build build
```

### ‚ûï DKUtil addon

This project bundles [DKUtil](https://github.com/gottyduke/DKUtil).
